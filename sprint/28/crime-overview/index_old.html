          <h2 id="section-1">Summary</h2>
          <p class="heading-small">Crime overall has fallen in the last year</p>
          <p>Crime estimated by Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) shows crime overall has fallen in the last year,  driven by a 28% decline in computer misuse.</p>
          <p>Most individual types of crime, including violence, have stayed at levels similar to the previous year.</p>
          <p>When looking at the main types of crime, changes were only seen in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>computer misuse offences (28% decrease to 1.37 million offences), which drove the fall in overall CSEW crime</li>
            <li>vehicle-related thefts (17% increase to 929,000 offences)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The increase in vehicle-related thefts is supported by a 16% increase in vehicle offences recorded by the police to 452,683 offences; a category that is well reported to the police and thought to be well recorded.</p>
          <p> All other <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables">main types of crime measured by the survey</a> showed no change.</p>

          <p class="heading-small">Police recorded crime</p>
          <p>Police recorded crime data showed evidence of rises in some other categories of crime,  particularly the more harmful, less frequently-occurring offences.</p>
          <p>The police figures indicate rises in the following types of crime:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>offences involving knives or sharp instrument (up 22% to 39,598 recorded offences)</li>
            <li>offences involving firearms (up 11% to 6,604 recorded offences)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These offences tend to be disproportionately concentrated in London and other metropolitan areas; however, the majority of police force areas saw rises in these types of violent crime.</p>
          <p>Police recorded crime also showed rises in: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>burglary, which increased by 9% (up to 438,971 offences)</li>
            <li>robbery (up 33% to 74,130 offences)</li>
            <li>homicides </li>
          </ul>
          <p>There were 54 more homicides than the previous year, a 9% rise to 653, excluding exceptional incidents with multiple victims such as the such as the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester, and events at Hillsborough in 1989, which were recorded as homicides in last year’s figures.</p>
          <p>Including these exceptional incidents the total number of homicides recorded by the police fell by 1% (to 688).</p>

          <p class="heading-small">Likelihood of being a victim has fallen considerably</p>
          <p>Around 4 in 10 adults were estimated to have been a victim of crime in 1995; before the survey included fraud and computer misuse in its coverage. In the year ending December 2017, just over 1 in 10 adults were a victim of crimes comparable with those measured in the 1995 survey. Including fraud and computer misuse, 2 in 10 adults were a victim of crime in the year ending December 2017.</p>

                  <p><strong>Strengths and limitations of the data</strong><br />The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) is a survey which asks people whether they have been victims of a crime over the past 12 months. The survey has been consistent since 1981 and therefore is the best source to use when looking at trends over time. It is also a better measurement of crimes which are less likely to be reported to the police, such as, sexual offences.</p>
                  <p>Police recorded crime is crime that has been reported to the police, and recorded as part of police casework, making these figures sensitive to changes in policing practices and victims’ willingness to report crime. Therefore, an increase in the number of crimes recorded by the police does not necessarily mean that crime itself has increased. While it is good for understanding how much work police forces are carrying out, it is not a useful way to monitor trends and we do not recommend using it for exploring crime trends.</p>
                  <p>Police recorded crime is a good measurement of:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Homicide</li>
                    <li>Firearm / gun crimes</li>
                    <li>Crimes involving a weapon</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
                  <p><strong>Time periods covered</strong><br />The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales figures presented in this release are based on interviews conducted between January 2017 and December 2017, measuring peoples’ experiences of crime in the 12 months before the interview.</p>
                  <p>The latest recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending December 2017 (between January 2017 and December 2017).</p>
