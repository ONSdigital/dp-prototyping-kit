          <p class="heading-medium">Proportion of people in work has generally increased since 2012</p>
          <p>The lowest employment rate for people was 65.6% in 1983, during the economic downturn of the early 1980s. The employment rates for people, men and women have been generally increasing since early 2012. For the latest time period, April to June 2018, the employment rate for people was 75.6%, up from 75.1% for a year earlier.</p>

          <div class="inset-text">
            <p class="panel">Employment measures the number of people aged from 16 to 64 years in paid work. It differs from the number of jobs because some people have more than one job.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="list-heading">For April to June 2018:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>75.6% of people aged from 16 to 64 years were in work, up from 75.1% for a year earlier</li>
            <li>80.1% of men aged from 16 to 64 years were in work; the employment rate for men has not been higher since February to April 1991</li>
            <li>71.0% of women aged from 16 to 64 years were in work, up from 70.5% for a year earlier</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The increase in the employment rate for women over the last few years has been partly due to ongoing changes to the State Pension age for women, resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 years.</p>

          <p>For April to June 2018, there were 32.39 million people in work, 42,000 more than for January to March 2018 and 313,000 more than for a year earlier.</p>

          <p>The following figure shows that more than half of the annual increase in the number of people in employment (313,000) was due to more women in full-time employment (170,000), with the number of men in full-time employment increasing by 101,000 over the year.</p>

The industrial sector showing the largest annual fall in the number of people in employment on “zero hours contracts” was human health and social work (down 62,000).

              <p><strong>Where does the data come from?</strong><br>
              Estimates of employment, unemployment, economic inactivity, hours worked and redundancies are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), a survey of households.</p>
              <p><strong>How is it measured?</strong><br>
              Employment measures the number of people aged from 16 to 64 years in paid work. It differs from the number of jobs because some people have more than one job.</p>
              <p>Everybody aged 16 years or over is either employed, unemployed or economically inactive. The employment estimates include all people in paid work including those working part-time. </p>
              <p>People not working are classed as unemployed if they have been looking for work within the last four weeks and are able to start work within the next two weeks. A common misconception is that the unemployment statistics are a count of people on benefits; this is not the case as they include unemployed people not claiming benefits.</p>
              <p>Jobless people who have not been looking for work within the last four weeks or who are unable to start work within the next two weeks are classed as economically inactive. Examples of economically inactive people include people not looking for work because they are students, looking after the family or home, because of illness or disability or because they have retired.</p>

                <p>Most of the figures in this statistical bulletin come from surveys of households or businesses and are therefore estimates rather than precise figures. Further information is available in <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/methodologies/aguidetolabourmarketstatistics">A guide to labour market statistics</a>.</p>
                <p>The most robust estimates of short-term movements in these estimates are obtained by comparing the estimates for April to June 2018 with the estimates for January to March 2018, which were first published on 15 May 2018.</p>
                <p>This provides a more robust estimate than comparing with the estimates for March to May 2018. This is because the April and May 2018 data are included within both estimates, so effectively observed differences are those between the individual months of March and June 2018.</p>
                <p>The LFS is sampled such that it is representative of the UK population over a three- month period, not for single month periods.</p>
