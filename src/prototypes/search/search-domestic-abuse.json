                "headline2": "Available data sources show that during the coronavirus pandemic, there was a 7% increase in police recorded offences flagged as domestic abuse-related between March and June 2020, compared with the same period in the previous year; however, there has been a gradual increase in these offences over recent years, therefore it cannot be determined whether this can be directly attributed to the coronavirus pandemic",
                "headline3": "For the 12-month period to year ending March 2020, the police recorded 758,941 domestic abuse-related crimes in England and Wales (excluding Greater Manchester Police)1, an increase of 9% from the previous year; this continues an ongoing trend that may reflect improved recording by the police alongside increased reporting by victims",
