      <h1>Writing about data</h1>
        <p>When we talk about content "about data", we generally mean methodology, definitions, strengths and limitations.</p>
        <p>Research has shown that this kind of information tends to be useful to a different, usually smaller, group of users than data and commentary. </p>
        <p>Structuring this content under clear headings helps the users who need this detail to find it, without slowing down people don't.</p>

      <h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
          <p>If you can avoid using a technical word, do so. The glossary should help users who are not familiar some of the terms or concepts described on the page. If you're not sure which terms to include, ask the content design team.</p>
          <p>Include up to six terms, with a description of up to 50 words. List the terms in alphabetical order. If you have a more detailed list of definitions on another page, link to it at the bottom of this section.</p>

          <div class="content-box">
            <h4 class="heading-medium">For example</h4>
              <p><strong>Firearms</strong></p>
              <p>Crimes include shotguns; handguns; rifles; imitation weapons such as BB guns or soft air weapons; other weapons such as CS gas or pepper spray and stun guns; and unidentified weapons. These figures exclude conventional air weapons, such as air rifles.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="measuring-this-data">Measuring this data</h2>
              <p>Up to 200 words explaining the data used on this page. If appropriate, use the following subheadings:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Where does the data come from?
                      <li>How is the data measured?
                      <li>Time periods covered</li>
                  </ul>
              <p>At the bottom of this section, include links to the Quality and Methodology Information document (QMI), the user guide, and up to three particularly useful methodology articles so that users can read on if they want to.</p>
              <p>This is also the place to link to articles about upcoming changes.</p>

                      <h3>Police recorded crime</h3>
                      <p><strong>Where does the data come from?</strong></p>
                      <p>The police record crimes as part of their casework.</p>
                      <p>Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>

                      <p><strong>How is the data measured?</strong></p>
                      <p>Data recorded by the police about crimes involving knives or sharp instruments are collected in a survey, separate to other types of police recorded crime.</p>

                      <p><strong>Time periods covered</strong></p>
                      <p>The police recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending December 2017 (between January 2017 and December 2017).</p>
                      <p><strong>Quality and Methodology Information</strong></p>
                      <p>More information on both these sources can be found in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales.</span></p>
                      <p>More information on the methodology can be found in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Crime in England and Wales Quality and Methodology Information

          <h2 id="strengths-and-limitations">Strengths and limitations</h2>
              <p>In fewer than 200 words, make clear any vital information the user needs to know so that they don't misuse or misunderstand the data.</p>
              <p>This can include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>whether this data has the National Statistician's designation
                      <li>recommendations about how the data should be used
                      <li>guidance on how to avoid misinterpretation
                      <li>any important methodology approaches or changes</li></ul>
              <p>Break up this section with subheadings to make it easier to read and signpost users to the most relevant content.</p>
              <p>This section should only include brief information which is critical to the way people use this data. Link to separate methodology articles so that users can find out more.</p>

              <h3>For example</h3>
                <div class="js-show-hide">
                  <div class="show-hide show-hide--light background--gallery margin-bottom--2">
                    <div class="js-show-hide__title">
                      <p class="heading-small">
                        Strengths and limitations</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="js-show-hide__content" style="overflow: auto;">
                      <p><strong>Strengths and limitations of the data</strong></p>
                    <p>The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) is the best source to use when looking at trends over time. It is also a better measurement of crimes which are less commonly reported, such as sexual offences.</p>
                    <p>Police recorded crime is a good measure of how much work police forces are carrying out. Changes in policing practices and victims' willingness to report crime can affected this data.</p>
                    <p>Police recorded crime is not a useful way to measure crime trends, and we do not recommend using it for this. Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reporting of knife crime can affect trends</strong></p>
                    <p>Police action on knife crime could lead to more knife crimes being detected.</p>
                    <p>It is likely that improvements in crime recording have affected the data. For example, 32% of the rise is due to an increase in people charged with possessing of firearms with intent. These offences may have been recorded as simple possession offences in the past.</p>
