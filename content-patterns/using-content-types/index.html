      <p>You can use bulletins or articles to write about statistics. Bulletins, articles and datasets are grouped and published in releases.</p>

      <h2 id="Bulletins">Bulletins</h2>
      <p>A bulletin gives headline numbers and commentary alongside essential quality and methodology information.</p>
      <p>It should be released with new data, linking to that data and to more detailed content for users who want more than an overview.</p>
      <p>Bulletins should focus on topics that we know users are interested in. If we know users are interested in a number of topics in a release, we can publish more than one bulletin in a "release".</p>
      <p>Where there's a clear user need for more detail on a specific topic (gender pay gap, for example), a release can contain more than one bulletin


      <table>
          <tr>
           <td><strong>A bulletin should give users</strong></td>
           <td><strong>A bulletin should not contain</strong>
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>An overview of the main findings, and first commentary on newly released data
           </td>
           <td>In-depth commentary
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>Links to the new data, and to specific parts of the data which might be useful
           </td>
           <td>Deep technical analysis
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>A summary of the most important quality and methodology information, linking to more detailed documents where necessary
           </td>
           <td>Detailed explanations of upcoming changes, roadmaps, or transformation plans
           </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      <br>

          <h3 id="Overview-bulletins">Overview bulletins</h3>
              <p>Where a release contains more than one bulletin, an overview summarises the most important information from across the whole release.</p>
              <p>For example, the <strong>Crime release</strong> may include bulletins on Weapons, Fraud and Homicide.</p>
              <p>The <strong>Crime overview</strong> would comment on overall Crime trends in the latest data, and might briefly explain the main causes of any changes (linking to the relevant bulletins for more detail).</p>

      <h2 id="Articles">Articles</h2>
          <p>An article is less structured than a bulletin, and allows for more detailed information on a subject. Typical articles might include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>deeper analysis of a topic that cannot fit in the bulletin template
              <li>analysis of the latest data alongside other data sources
              <li>more information about methodology or planned changes to a future release</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As with any content on our website, there should be a clear user need for everything we publish. The length and detail of an article should be relative to the interest of our users. We will measure this using analytics and through user research.</p>
          <p>An article should only be used when it is not possible to communicate all of the information users need in a bulletin (because of the number of words required, or because the analysis crosses multiple bulletins or releases, for example).</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-decide-whether-you-need-more-pages">How to decide whether you need more bulletins</h2>
              <p>Digital publishing will help you determine whether more pages would add value. We will use search data and user research to understand what users need. We may run extra research, or suggest small-scale experiments we can run to validate the need for a new page.</p>
              <p>We will also consider:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>whether users might expect to find information about this topic anywhere else (on another page in this release, or elsewhere on the ONS website, for example)
                  <li>how the user need relates to the time and effort required to create and publish extra content
                  <li>can we communicate this using anything that already exists
                  <li>does it need to be published on the day of release
                  <li>whether this content is best written as an article or a bulletin</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Once the page has been published, we will continually monitor its use to understand whether there is a continuing user need for this content.</p>
