      <h1 id="Analysis">Writing bulletin analysis</h1>

      <p>When writing stories about statistics, focus on the 'story' – what's interesting, noteworthy or important.</p>
      <p>Don't couch the story in warnings. Where there are questions about the reliability of the data, say so as briefly as possible. Avoid repeating caveats throughout your stories.</p>

  <h2 id="lead-finding">Lead finding</h2>
      <p>  This should be the most important story about your new data. When thinking about importance, consider:
      </p><ul>

      <li>what is the most interesting thing about the new data?
      <li>is that something that most users will find interesting?
      <li>is it statistically significant?
      <li>could anything about this point be misleading? </li></ul>

      <p>The lead finding can be made up of:</p>

      <p><strong>A headline</strong></p>
          <p>Your lead finding should always have a headline. This should be less than 90 characters, summarise the most important story in your bulletin, and accurately describe any accompanying visuals or text.</p>
                <div class="content-box">
                  <h4> For example </h4>
                  <h2>Firearm crimes have increased for the first time since 2005</h2>
                </div>

          <p><strong>Visual</strong></p>
          <p>This will typically be a chart, and should back up the message in the headline. A subtitle should describe the statistical measure, geographic coverage and time period as briefly as possible.</p></p>
              <div class="content-box">
                <h4> For example </h4>
                <h4>England and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending December 2017</h4>
                <img style="width:100%" src="{{ "/assets/img/charts/weapons_firearm_chart_lg.png" | relative_url }}" class="" alt="">
                <p class="font-xsmall">Source: Police recorded crime, Home Office</p>
              </div>

          <p><strong>A quote</strong></p>
          <p>Where a chart could be misleading, or isn't appropriate, consider using a quote instead.</p>
          <p>The quote should be 50 to 60 words, and clearly attributed to an ONS employee, with their job title.</p>
          <p>Remember that you can add a quote alongside your lead finding, which can be useful if you need to add an explanation.</p>
          <p>The quote should not contradict the headline or visual from your lead point.</p>
              <div class="content-box">
                <h4> For example </h4>
                {% include quote.html %}
              </div>

          <p><strong>Bullet points</strong></p>
          <p>Where there are three or four short points to make which give more information about the lead finding. Each point should be a single, concise sentence.</p>
              <div class="content-box">
                <h4> For example </h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Knife crime rose 22%</li>
                  <li>Gun crime rose 11%</li>
                  <li>63% of the increase in gun crime was driven by rises in London and Manchester</li>
                </ul>
              </div>


  <h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
    <p>A finding is a trend from the data which is worth reporting. It
    should answer a question the user might have about your statistics.</p>
    <p>Main findings consist of a title and commentary. Add visuals, such as charts,
    tables, or interactives to back up each point. Use warnings to draw
    attention to essential limitations or uncertainty which might affect the way
    people interpret statistics.</p>
    <p>Aim for five or six main points on a page, adding up to no more than 800 words. If
    you know that users want to know more, consider adding more pages to your
    release.</p>
    <p>Communicating clearly with a small number of words can be difficult and time
    consuming, but we know it's what our users need. The content design team can
    help if you're finding anything difficult.</p>
        <table>
        <tr>
        <td><strong>Do</strong>
        </td>
        <td><strong>Don't</strong>
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Use descriptive titles – users need to know what the text beneath a
        headline will tell them.
        </td>
        <td>Use your data source as the headline – you can mention the source, but
        find the thing that users will find interesting about that data source.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Say something useful and interesting in each point.
        </td>
        <td>Use points just to report on the findings from different sources of data.

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Create a new point for each new "idea".
        </td>
        <td>Try to talk about more than one thing in each point.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Base your points on themes, not data sources.
        </td>

        whether you need another page.

        <tr>
        <td>
        </td>
        <td>Write extra points if there's nothing to say – it's fine if summaries are
        short.
        </td>
        </tr>
        </table>

  <br>
    <p><h2 id="headings">Headings</h2></p>
        <p>
        Describe the finding as clearly as you can in the shortest number of words. When
        people read web pages, their eyes scan shapes and headings first, trying to find
        which bits of the page are going to be most useful to them.</p>
        <p>Even at a glance, headings should say something meaningful, and give a clear idea what the following
        commentary is about. Front-loading your title with the most important information helps users find what they need more quickly.</p>
          <p>
            <div class="content-box">
              <h4 class="heading-medium">For example</h4>
              <h5>Police recorded rises in knife and gun crime, mainly in large cities</h5>
            </div>
             <p>
        Be clear if there's any uncertainty in the point you're making, or you need to
        add context, but keep it simple. Complex terms or awkward phrasing reduced
        people's ability to understand and retain information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="content-box">
            <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
            <h4>Crime Survey shows long-term drop in violent crime but little change in
            recent years</h4>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you can't say it simply, consider whether it should be a main point – can you
        highlight something more useful?
        </p>
        <p>
        The title should be less than 20 words (about 90 characters), to avoid running
        over two lines on a desktop.
        </p>
        <p>

    <p><h2 id="Commentary">Commentary</h2></p>
        <p>Your text should be in concise, plain English and written with the user in mind.
        Consider what is the most important information that supports your title.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure something is going to be useful or interesting, don't include
        it. Users can still find the data in datasets and further detail can be explored
        in an accompanying article.
        <p>Use text and charts or tables to give more detail and context to your title.</p>
        <p>The first paragraph of each section must contain the most important fact. Use
        further paragraphs and figures to add more detail and context to broaden the
        user's understanding.</p>

    <p><h2 id="Warnings">Warnings</h2></p>
          <p>Warnings are designed to grab the user's attention. They can be inserted anywhere
          in your commentary to bring attention to very important information.</p>

    <h2 id="charts-and-interactives">Charts and interactives</h2>
        <p>
        Use charts to deliver a clear message visually. If a chart doesn't tell its own
        "story", or doesn't fit with the narrative of the point you're writing, consider
        whether it's really needed.
        </p>
        <p>
        Use interactive charts and maps sparingly when they can bring an extra dimension
        to your data.
        </p>
        <p>
        Contact the ONS Data Visualisation Centre (datavis@ons.gov.uk) for advice and
        guidance on interactive charts. Contact ONS Geography for support with maps (ons.geography@ons.gov.uk).
      </p>

    <p><h3>Chart titles and subtitles</h3></p>
        <p>
        Charts should have a main title and a statistical subtitle, be concise and in
        sentence case.
        </p>
        <p>
        The main title should be descriptive, and tell the trend of the data or
        highlight the main story. Try to limit the number of words to no more than 10.
        This should make the description easier to read and avoid the text wrapping onto
        several lines, especially on mobile devices. If you need to add context or
        detail to the chart, use <a
        href="https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/titles-and-text/#annotation-and-footnotes">annotations</a>
        or support with your analysis.
        </p>
            <div class="content-box">
              <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
              <h4>Figure 1: Highest overall employment rate since 1971</h4>
            </div>
          <p>
        The statistical subtitle should be as short as possible and must include the:
        </p><ul>
          <li>statistical measure
          <li>geographic coverage
          <li>time period</li></ul>
                <div class="content-box">
                  <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
                  <h4>UK employment rates (aged 16 to 64 years), seasonally adjusted, 1971 to 2018</h4>
                </div>
        <p>
        When writing your chart title and analysis, take care to:
        </p><ul>
          <li>avoid repeating section headings
          <li>avoid repeating what you have written about in your analysis
          <li>add further context and explanation of the chart's message in your main
          text</li></ul>
        <p>

    <h3>Sources</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
        Figures and tables must provide a source, in the following format:
        </p>
        <p>[ORGANISATION], [PUBLICATION OR SOURCE OF DATA]</p>
            <div class="content-box">
              <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
              <h4>Office for National Statistics, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings</h4>
            </div>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>

    <h3>Footnotes</h3>

        <p>Avoid chart footnotes – they lengthen then page, require the user to switch their attention between
        the chart and text beneath, and lessen the likelihood that people will understand and retain information.</p>
        <p>If extra information is needed:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>annotate the chart
        <li>include the information in the commentary accompanying the chart</li></ul>

          <p>A descriptive title and statistical subtitle help users understand what the chart says. A clear annotation adds detail, and the time period gives context.

    </div>

<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
    <p>
    Tables can capture a great deal of data but often aren't the clearest or most
    transparent way of presenting the statistics or telling the story – a chart is
    usually clearer, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
    Show only the data you need to evidence the point you're making. If a user wants
    all of the data, they can download it. Only use tables in your bulletin if there
    is a strong justification for doing so.
    </p>
